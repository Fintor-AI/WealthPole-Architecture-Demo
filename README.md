# FintorAI Python Trading Bot Starter

A production-grade starter template for building algorithmic trading bots in **Python** — designed for Forex, Crypto, and multi-asset execution.

This project focuses on **clean architecture**, **risk-aware design**, and **extensibility**.  
It is intentionally engineered like a professional trading system, *not* a “get rich quick" script.

---

## 🔧 What You Can Build With This Starter

- REST & WebSocket-based trading bots (Binance / OKX / others)  
- Signal-driven or fully automated execution engines  
- Modular **risk & position sizing systems**  
- Multi-symbol, multi-timeframe workflows  
- Backtesting and analytics pipelines  
- Logging, monitoring, and structured configuration via YAML  

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

The project is organized into clear, testable modules:

- `config/` — API keys, strategy config, risk profiles  
- `core/` — trading engine & shared abstractions  
- `strategies/` — plug-and-play strategy modules  
- `exchanges/` — exchange connectors  
- `utils/` — logging & common helpers  

This template is meant to be an **engineering-grade skeleton**:  
strong enough to build real bots, lightweight enough to extend freely.

## 🚀 Quickstart

1) Install dependencies  
pip install -r requirements.txt

2) Run the bot in paper mode  
python src/main.py -c config/settings_example.yaml

Expected output:
Settings loaded successfully.
Bot: FintorAI Starter Bot
Mode: paper
[TODO] Plug in execution engine, exchanges, and strategy here.
